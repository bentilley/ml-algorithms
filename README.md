# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

The following repo is a collection of machine learning algorithms that I have
implemented myself using `numpy`.

The algorithms are written up in Jupyter notebooks along side notes for the
maths behind each algorithm (written inline using Mathjax).

## Viewing the notebooks

To view the notebooks yourself simply clone the repo, set up a virtual env, then run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## Current Algorithms

So far I have implemented the following algorithms:

- Linear Regression with one variable using gradient descent;
- Multi-variable Linear Regression using gradient descent.

#### TODO

- Decision Trees (ID3)
- Support Vector Machines
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbours
